# Announcements

### Week 2 (1/29 - 2/4)

* The main goal this week is to talk about model building. What to look for, how to compare between models or variables, when to stop. 
* Review the course notes and corresponding textbook chapters,and be prepared to answer the questions in the notebook. 
* You'll also form project teams on Monday. Be sure to have your preferences submitted to me via Slack DM by Sunday EOD. 

### Week 1 (1/22 - 1/28): Welcome!

* Welcome to spring semester in statistics with your host, Dr. Robin Donatello. 
* Make sure you acquaint yourself with this website, it will be your guide for the next 16 weeks. 
* We will use several online tools throughout this class, try to get signed up for all of them before Monday. 
    - Look under `materials` and `tools` links in the navbar for the list. 
    - Update your version of `R studio` for sure. Update R if you're running < 3.4. 
        - Go to `[Tools]` --> `[Global Options]` to check the version of R that R Studio is using. 
        - Re-install your commonly used packages.(Can be painful. Esp for `Rcpp`)
* If you've had me in a class before, you know that there *will* be typos and broken links on this webpage. 
    - 1) breath, and recognize that I'm human too.
    - 2) good: tell me then email me (this second step is pretty critical unless you witness me fix the code right then.)
    - 2) better: open up an Issue in Github
    - 2) best: fork the repo and submit a PR with the fix!
