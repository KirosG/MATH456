# Announcements

### Week 10 (4/2 - 4/8)
* Abstract submissions for the [[College of Natural Science Poster Session]](https://www.csuchico.edu/nsci/event/poster.shtml) are open until April 16th 
    - Submission is a mandatory assignment for this class
* We're going to finish talking about the Random Intercept model this week
    - the common methods of fitting these models in R
    - and some common methods of handling covariates in multilevel models. 
* The schedule has been updated to reflect the "surprise" holiday last Friday, and the change in poster session date. 
    - The final date has been posted, along with information about the take home portion of the final. 
    

### Week 9 (3/26 - 4/1)
* Exam corrections - Must use error assessment document. A copy can be found [[here]](notes/analyzingexamerrors.pdf) and also in the #general channel in Slack. 
* Starting a section on correlated data. QFT on Monday, lecture wed, open work day Friday. 
* Grading status: Gradebook will be fully updated by Tuesday. 


### Week 8 (3/12 - 3/16)
* Fast forwarding...
* **Midterm** this week! 60% in class, 40% take home. 
    - Midterm review on Monday. 
    - Class generated using QFT model of question formulation
    - This is worth participation points, so be there and contribute!
    - Midterm materials allowed: 2 pages of notes & a calculator. 
* Take home portion with instructions posted in Slack `#assignments` channel by EOB (end of business).
* **Project updates** - this is worth 20 pts, so make it good. You have 4-5 minutes and 3-4 slides to show me that
    - you know what your data consists of
    - you have gotten it into R and started exploring/visualizing/cleaning
    - you should be starting to do bivariate comparisons at this point
    - you have a clear idea of what model you are working towards
    - and that EVERYONE is contributing. Everyone must share in the presentation
  

### Week 5 (2/19 - 2/25)

* No new content this week. Working/practicing your model writing and calculating various classification measurements. 
* Wednesday worksheet: [Classifying Glass](notes/classifying glass.Rmd)
* Friday will be an open project work day. 


### Week 4 (2/12 - 2/18)

* Solutions to MLR assignment uploaded to Google Drive. I'll be working my way through the grading this week. 
* This week -- Generalized Linear Models. What to do when your outcome isn't continuous. 
* We'll talk about 2 cases, binary and count data. Just how to fit and interpret Logistic and Poisson models. 
* New GLM assignment starting, all reviews for Model building are done by Sunday (tonight) EOD. 

### Week 3 (2/5 - 2/11)

* Recap of the process of building a model
* Team check in - Tell me where you are at and what you are working on this week. How can the class help you make progress? 
* Reminders: Regression assignment due Wed, Model building due Friday. 


### Week 2 (1/29 - 2/4)

* The main goal this week is to talk about model building. What to look for, how to compare between models or variables, when to stop. 
* Review the course notes and corresponding textbook chapters,and be prepared to answer the questions in the notebook. 
* You'll also form project teams on Monday. Be sure to have your preferences submitted to me via Slack DM by Sunday EOD. 

### Week 1 (1/22 - 1/28): Welcome!

* Welcome to spring semester in statistics with your host, Dr. Robin Donatello. 
* Make sure you acquaint yourself with this website, it will be your guide for the next 16 weeks. 
* We will use several online tools throughout this class, try to get signed up for all of them before Monday. 
    - Look under `materials` and `tools` links in the navbar for the list. 
    - Update your version of `R studio` for sure. Update R if you're running < 3.4. 
        - Go to `[Tools]` --> `[Global Options]` to check the version of R that R Studio is using. 
        - Re-install your commonly used packages.(Can be painful. Esp for `Rcpp`)
* If you've had me in a class before, you know that there *will* be typos and broken links on this webpage. 
    - 1) breath, and recognize that I'm human too.
    - 2) good: tell me then email me (this second step is pretty critical unless you witness me fix the code right then.)
    - 2) better: open up an Issue in Github
    - 2) best: fork the repo and submit a PR with the fix!
