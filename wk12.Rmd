#### Spatio-Temporal Assignment: Part II

_Details forthcoming, but it will generally include the following items: _


* Create a plot of ozone over time of day, paneled by city. 
* Make a map centered around LA. Plot the ozone data cities as points on this map. 
    - Size the points according to a) the average and b) the peak ozone levels in that area.  
    - Place these plots side by side using `grid.arrange`
    - Comment on if there appears to be any spatial trends or clustering. 
* Identify neighbors as cities that are within 10 miles of each other. 
    - Create a new plot that connects the neighboring cities with a line. 
    - Comment on whether or not these neighbors seem to match with any ozone clustering seen in the first plot. 
    - For this geographic region, is distance measured "as the crow flies" an appropriate way to identify neighbors?
    - Hunt around on google for alternative ways to cluster these cities based on topography. 
* [optional?] Analyze (using a plot, summary statistics and a statistical analysis) the relationship between altitude and ozone.
